      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
          It is often asked, "What is more important - time or money?" I believe that 
          Steve Jobs answered the question best, "It's really clear that the most precious 
          resource we all have is time."  Over the course of my lifetime, I have learned 
          that you can always make more money. You can't make more time.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have dedicated my life to serving others and have given over fifteen years of             
          my life to my career in medicine. I attended my local community college as a high 
          school student. I attended the University of California, San Diego for my 
          bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and Cell Biology, with a minor in Ethnic 
          Studies. I obtained my doctorate degree at Des Moines University and completed 
          my Family Practice residency at Glendale Adventist Medical Center in Pasadena.  
          I served as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy immediately following             
          residency graduation and worked as a Family Practice doctor for Sharp Mission 
          Park and Scripps Coastal Medical Group in San Diego.  
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the past nine years, I have transitioned into a career in business 
          telecommunications in order to find a lifestyle more conducive to a single mother 
          raising three children.  I have served in a pro-bono capacity as a doctor for a             
          majority of that time. In alignment with my entrepreneurial spirit, I have created 
          a non-profit organization, Blessed Beyond Belief, Inc., and two other for-profit 
          corporations, Grace Enterprises and Unconventionalism, Inc..
        </p>
     
      <h2>Why I Am Attending IIT</h2>
        <p>
          The mission of Grace Enterprises is to use ingenuity and technology to ensure that 
          our families are taken care of and create a culture that allows us pursue our 
          higher purpose in life.  One of the focus points of Blessed Beyond Belief, Inc. 
          and Unconventionalism, Inc. is to increase awareness and provide services for those 
          who are advocates of sexual abuse victims or those have been sexually abused. Other 
          main focus points of the corporations are to protect children, create change agents 
          in the world at large and bridge the gap through new and existing community             
          outreach programs to help individuals thrive mentally, emotionally, physically, 
          spiritually, professionally and financially, as well as to create an open dialogue 
          within the community regarding issues that affect an individual's emotional, 
          mental, spiritual well-being and to promote healing and growth in a manner that 
          breaks down traditional religious, societal, stereotypical barriers. In order to 
          accomplish these goals, I believe that a foundation in information technology will             
          be a vital enhancement to my career goals and only serves to strengthen the success 
          of my businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The corporations, as well as some of the service options offered through the 
          corporations, require web development knowledge and the creation of several social 
          media applications. 
        </p>
        <p>
          It is for the reasons listed above that I am pursing a degree in information 
          technology and management and am extremely excited about the entrepreneurial and 
          innovative aspects of the degree.  I plan to create several applications that will 
          benefit individuals socially and  medically through my corporations and believe 
          that the Illinois Institute of Technology will play an integral role in the 
          accomplishment of those goals, overall corporation goals, and in my life's mission 
          to serve others.
